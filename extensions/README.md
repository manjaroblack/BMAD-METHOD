# BMad Method Extensions

Extensions are additional capabilities that can be added to your BMad installation. They are installed into the `.bmad-core/extensions/` directory and provide specialized agents, workflows, and knowledge bases for specific domains.

When you install an extension, it adds files to your `.bmad-core` directory:

- `.bmad-core/extensions/[extension-name]/` - Extension-specific files
- `.bmad-core/agents/` - Additional agents (if any)
- `.bmad-core/workflows/` - Additional workflows (if any)
- `.bmad-core/data/` - Additional knowledge bases (if any)
