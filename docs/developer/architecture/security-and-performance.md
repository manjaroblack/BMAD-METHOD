# **Security and Performance**

* **Security**: Focuses on **Deno runtime permissions**, requesting only what is necessary (--allow-read, \--allow-write, \--allow-run, \--allow-net). Dependencies are pinned and audited.  
* **Performance**: Aims for instant UI feedback (\<50ms) through a Signal-based architecture. Backend operations are optimized for speed (\<100ms for file I/O).
