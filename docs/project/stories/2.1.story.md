# Story 2.1: TUI application shell and main menu scaffolding

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** Developer, **I want** to implement the TUI application shell (with dynamic header) and the
Main Menu view with signal-based routing, **so that** users see the core entry points and we can
route to workflows in later stories.

### Dependencies

- Depends on completion of Stories 1.1–1.3
- Parent Epic:
  [Epic 2 – TUI Core & Toolkit Implementation](../prd/epic-2-tui-core-toolkit-implementation.md)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. TUI Application Shell exists and manages overall layout and global key presses; includes a
   dynamic header per Epic 2 scope. (Epic 2 Key Features: dynamic header)
   - Header includes: app name + version, current view, and installed status (derived from state
     adapter); show `?` for help
   - Global keys: `q` to exit, `?` to open help
     [Source](../architecture/frontend-architecture-tui.md)
2. Main Menu View is implemented and renders separate options for Install, Update, Uninstall, and
   Toolkit, with visibility determined by system state.
   [Source](../architecture/components.md#ui-components)
3. Signal-based routing is in place: a global `currentView` signal controls which view renders
   (e.g., MainMenu).
   - Define a `View` type (string union or enum) and type the `currentView` signal accordingly
     [Source](../architecture/frontend-architecture-tui.md)
4. Views communicate with Core Services via dependency injection; for this story, define service
   interfaces and wire menu actions to call them (stubs), without implementing service internals.
   [Source](../architecture/frontend-architecture-tui.md) •
   [Source](../architecture/backend-architecture-core-services.md)
5. State for menu visibility is driven by a thin adapter over the Installation Manifest; for this
   story, read-only state and schema alignment are defined (no write operations).
   - Source read-only state via a `ManifestRepository` interface injected into the adapter; tests
     stub this repository [Source](../architecture/data-models.md#installationmanifest)
6. Tests:
   - Unit tests cover menu rendering for at least two states (fresh install vs installed) and
     routing changes when selecting an option.
   - Tests reside under top-level `tests/` mirroring `src/` structure and run with Deno's test
     runner. [Source](../architecture/testing-strategy.md)

7. Centralized dependency exports are in place: `deps.ts` re-exports Preact Signals and the chosen
   TUI library used by this story.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- Unified project structure is scaffolded; CLI bootstrap exists and tests pass.
  [Source](1.2.story.md#dev-notes)
- Documentation pipeline and CI are configured; doctests and API docs lint run in CI.
  [Source](1.3.story.md#ci-responsibilities)

### Data Models

- InstallationManifest schema defines core/module presence; use a read-only adapter in this story to
  determine installed state for menu visibility.
  [Source](../architecture/data-models.md#installationmanifest)

### Component Specifications

- TUI Application Shell manages layout and global keys; Main Menu View lists
  Install/Update/Uninstall/Toolkit. [Source](../architecture/components.md#ui-components)
- Signal-based architecture with Preact Signals; routing via `currentView`.
  [Source](../architecture/frontend-architecture-tui.md)

### Services and Integration

- Services are modular and injected; define interfaces now and wire menu actions to them via DI;
  implementation follows in later stories.
  [Source](../architecture/backend-architecture-core-services.md) •
  [Source](../architecture/frontend-architecture-tui.md)

### File Locations

- Place views under `src/tui/views/`; shell under `src/tui/`; services under `src/services/`; DI
  under `src/core/`; tests under top-level `tests/`.
  [Source](../architecture/unified-project-structure.md#tui-application-structure)

### Testing Requirements

- Use Deno test runner; tests mirror `src/`; include doctests where applicable.
  [Source](../architecture/testing-strategy.md)

### Technical Constraints

- Runtime: Deno 2; Language: TypeScript; centralized dependencies via `deps.ts`; DI and immutability
  preferred. [Source](../architecture/tech-stack.md) • [Source](../architecture/coding-standards.md)

### Permissions

- Default: no network access.
- File system: read-only access for reading the Installation Manifest via the `ManifestRepository`.
- TTY: interactive stdin/stdout for TUI rendering.
- Tests: prefer per-test `permissions` in `Deno.test` rather than global flags (see
  `../architecture/testing-strategy.md`).

### Project Structure Notes

- Ensure paths and module names align with the unified structure; keep `legacy/` untouched.
  [Source](../architecture/unified-project-structure.md#tui-application-structure)

### Dependency Management

- Centralize exports in `deps.ts` for Preact Signals (`signal`, `computed`, `effect`, and
  `type Signal`) and the selected TUI library. Prefer JSR specifiers; if unavailable, use a pinned,
  reproducible URL import consistent with project rules.
  [Source](../typescript-rules.md#dependency--import-strategy-jsr-first-depsts-pinning) •
  [Source](../architecture/tech-stack.md)

### Routing Type

- Define `src/tui/views/types.ts` with a `View` string union or enum (e.g., `MainMenu`,
  `InstallerWizard`, etc.) and type `currentView` accordingly.
  [Source](../architecture/frontend-architecture-tui.md)

### Dynamic Header Content

- Header should render app name + version, current view, and installed status (derived from the
  state adapter). Keep within TUI layout constraints and update reactively.
  [Source](../architecture/frontend-architecture-tui.md) • (AC: 1)

### Global Keys

- Provide `q` to exit and `?` to open help from the shell. Make these consistent across views.
  (AC: 1)

### State & Repository

- Introduce a `ManifestRepository` interface and inject it into `installation_state.ts` for
  read-only state; tests can stub this to cover fresh vs installed scenarios.
  [Source](../architecture/backend-architecture-core-services.md) •
  [Source](../architecture/data-models.md#installationmanifest)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-14

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

- Overall: Implementation meets ACs. Clean separation of concerns and centralized deps via `deps.ts`.
- Architecture: Signal-based routing (`src/tui/router.ts`), typed `View` (`src/tui/views/types.ts`), DI stubs (`src/core/di.ts`), and read-only state adapter (`src/core/state/installation_state.ts`) align with Dev Notes.
- UI Shell: Dynamic header reflects `APP_NAME`/`VERSION`, current view, and installed status; global keys wired (`?` → Help, `q` → exit) in `src/tui/TuiApplication.ts`.
- Tests: Cover fresh vs installed visibility and routing activation (`tests/tui/main_menu_view_test.ts`). CLI smoke tests present (`tests/cli_main_test.ts`).
- Notes: Help view is navigable by key but not yet implemented as a view (acceptable for this story).

### Refactoring Performed

- None required during this review pass; code aligns with story guidance and TS rules.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Strict TS config; clean imports via `deps.ts`; exact version pins.
- Project Structure: ✓ Files match listed locations; TUI views under `src/tui/views/`, shell under `src/tui/`.
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Unit tests under `tests/`; stubs used for repo/DI; mirrors `src/`.
- All ACs Met: ✓ AC 1–7 validated by code inspection; tests cover AC 6 scenarios.

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Add a simple `Help` view stub to render help when `?` is pressed; add a minimal test for navigation.
- [ ] Add unit tests for other buttons (Install/Uninstall/Toolkit) to mirror Update routing assertion.
- [ ] Consider a tiny `Header` component wrapper to encapsulate signal bridge logic (optional, clarity).
- [ ] Add a CLI test for `--manifest` path mapping in `src/tui/cli.ts` (fresh vs installed JSON shapes).

### Security Review

- ✓ No issues found. Remote imports pinned (JSR/std, esm.sh, deno.land). No network or FS writes in story scope. `CliManifestRepository` guards JSON parsing and treats errors as not installed.

### Performance Considerations

- ✓ No issues found. TUI refresh at ~30 FPS with minimal reactive updates. Signal computations are O(1) and scope-limited.

### Final Status

- ✓ Approved - Ready for Done (pending confirmation of local/CI test run)
