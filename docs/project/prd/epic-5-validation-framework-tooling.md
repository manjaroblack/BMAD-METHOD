# **Epic 5: Validation Framework & Tooling**  

* **Goal:** Create the validation scripts for internal tools and external modules to ensure they adhere to the new framework standards.  
* **Key Features:** Develop a validation service to check for required components in a tool (banner art, CLI options, etc.), integrate validator into deno.json test scripts, develop a similar validator for modules.

## Documentation & Testing

* Validator service API is documented with JSDoc/TSDoc; usage recipes are included and executable as doctests.
* deno task integration (e.g., invoking the validator within `deno task test`) is documented with examples and verified by `deno task docs:test`.
* A user/developer guide page for Validation exists in `docs/` and is indexed by Pagefind in the Lume site build.
* Cross-link to `../architecture/documentation-strategy.md` for reference.
