# **Introduction**

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the BMad-Method TUI, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack. This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## **Starter Template or Existing Project**

Based on my analysis of the PRD, this project is a significant enhancement to the existing BMad-Method framework. The core technical approach involves building a new Text-based User Interface (TUI) from scratch using **Deno** and **TypeScript**. The existing Node.js-based scripts and logic will be archived into a /legacy directory for reference, not used as a direct foundation for the new code.

Therefore, while this is a "brownfield" project in context, the TUI component itself will be a greenfield implementation. No external starter template is specified; the architecture will be defined based on the principles outlined in the PRD.
