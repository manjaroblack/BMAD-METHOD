# BMAD-METHOD Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The BMAD-METHOD system has been comprehensively refactored using modern software architecture patterns based on 2024-2025 best practices. This documentation provides a complete overview of the modular architecture implemented across all system components.

## Architecture Principles

### Core Design Principles

- **Interface-Based Design**: All components use dependency injection with clear interfaces
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each module handles one specific concern
- **Modular Architecture**: Components are organized in focused, maintainable modules (target: <500 lines)
- **Strict Typing**: Comprehensive TypeScript types with enums and validation rules
- **Event-Driven Patterns**: Asynchronous communication through event systems

### Refactoring Strategy Applied

1. **Red-Green-Refactor**: Test-driven incremental improvements
2. **Refactoring by Abstraction**: Extract interfaces, eliminate redundancy
3. **Composing Methods**: Break large methods into focused functions
4. **Pull-Up/Push-Down Methods**: Optimize inheritance hierarchies
5. **Dependency Injection**: Loose coupling through interface-based design

## System Architecture

### Phase 1-3: Foundation & Core Decomposition ✅

The installer system was completely modularized from a monolithic 1,057-line file into 20+ focused modules:

```
tooling/installers/
├── core/
│   ├── installer-orchestrator.ts        # Main coordination (200-300 lines)
│   ├── installation-detector.ts         # State detection (150-250 lines)
│   └── installation-types.ts           # Shared interfaces (50-100 lines)
├── handlers/
│   ├── fresh-install-handler.ts        # Fresh installation (200-300 lines)
│   ├── update-handler.ts               # Update logic (150-250 lines)
│   ├── repair-handler.ts               # Repair logic (100-200 lines)
│   └── unknown-install-handler.ts      # Unknown state (100-150 lines)
├── services/
│   ├── core-installer.ts               # Core installation (250-400 lines)
│   ├── expansion-pack-service.ts       # Expansion packs (200-350 lines)
│   ├── manifest-service.ts             # Manifest ops (150-250 lines)
│   └── integrity-checker.ts            # File integrity (100-200 lines)
└── utils/
    ├── version-comparator.ts           # Version comparison (50-100 lines)
    ├── file-operations.ts              # File operations (150-250 lines)
    └── agent-generator.ts              # Agent generation (200-300 lines)
```

### Phase 5: Core Domain Services & Agent System ✅

Implemented comprehensive agent, workflow, and task management systems:

```
src/core/
├── agents/
│   ├── types/agent.types.ts            # Agent type definitions
│   ├── base/base-agent.ts              # Abstract base agent class
│   ├── registry/agent-registry.ts      # Agent registry service
├── workflows/
│   ├── types/workflow.types.ts         # Workflow type definitions
│   ├── engine/workflow-engine.ts       # Workflow execution engine
├── tasks/
│   ├── types/task.types.ts             # Task type definitions
│   ├── scheduler/task-scheduler.ts     # Task scheduling service
│   ├── executors/task-executor.ts      # Task execution service
└── services/
    └── agent-manager.service.ts        # Agent lifecycle management
```

### Phase 6: Extension Ecosystem ✅

Built a comprehensive extension framework supporting multiple extension types:

```
src/core/extensions/
├── types/extension.types.ts            # Extension type system
├── services/extension-manager.service.ts # Extension lifecycle management
├── loaders/extension-loader.ts         # Resource parsing and validation
└── registry/extension-registry.service.ts # Extension registry with dependency graphs
```

**Supported Extension Types:**

- Game Development (Phaser, Unity)
- Infrastructure & DevOps
- Custom Extensions with plugin architecture

### Phase 7: Tooling Modularization ✅

Implemented a modern CLI framework with plugin-based architecture:

```
tooling/cli/
├── types/cli.types.ts                  # CLI framework types
├── core/cli-framework.ts               # Plugin-based CLI system
├── commands/
│   ├── build.command.ts                # Modular build system
│   └── version-management.command.ts   # Version management commands
```

**CLI Features:**

- Plugin-based command system
- Middleware support
- Event-driven architecture
- Comprehensive help system
- Metrics tracking
